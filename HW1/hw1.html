<p><strong>In this assignment, you will write a course planner for Stony Brook
students. The planner is simply a list where students can record the courses they
want to take in order of preference. A course contains general information such
as course name, course code, course section, instructor, etc. We will simplify
the course to include these basic information. The planner should be able to record
a total of 50 courses, a number which should be declared as a final variable.</strong></p>

<h2><strong><u>SPECIFICATIONS</u></strong></h2>

<p><strong>1. Write a fully-documented class named <span class="code">Course</span>
which contains the course name (String), department (String), code (int), section
 (byte), and instructor (String). You should provide accessor and mutator methods
for each variable. The mutator methods for code and section should throw an
appropriate exception for invalid values (e.g. a negative value). Also, include
a constructor for the class, as well as the <span class="code">clone()</span> and
<span class="code">equals()</span> methods. The full list of required methods is: </strong></p>

<ul><strong>
    <li><span class="code">public Course</span> - constructor (you may include a
        constructor with parameters)</li>
    <li>getter/setter methods for each variable</li>
    <li><span class="code">public Object clone()</span> - the return value is a
        copy of this Course. Subsequent changes to the copy will not affect the
        original and vice versa. Note that the return value must be typecasted to
        a Course before it can be used.</li>
    <li><span class="code">public boolean equals(Object obj)</span> - a return
        value of true indicates that obj refers to a Course object with the same
        attributes as this Course. Otherwise, the return value is false.</li>
</strong></ul>

<p><strong>2. Write a fully-documented class named <span class="code">Planner</span>
which stores an ordered list of Course objects. The array indices
determine the preference of the courses <span class="input">
(do not use ArrayList, Vector, or any other Java API Data Structures)</span>. A student can insert a course at any
position within the range of the list. Make sure there are no gaps between courses
on the list. Note that arrays in Java are 0 indexed, but your listing preference
should start from 1. The Planner can record a total of 50 courses, so use the
final variable <span class="code">MAX_COURSES = 50</span> (and refrain from using
the number 50 within your code). The class will be based on the following ADT
specification:</strong></p>

<p><strong><span class="code">public class Planner</span><br>The Planner class
implements an abstract data type for a list of courses supporting some common
operations on such lists.</strong></p>

<ul><strong>
    <li><span class="code">public Planner</span><br>Constructs an instance of
    the Planner with no Course objects in it.<br><i>Postcondition:</i><br>This
    Planner has been initialized to an empty list of Courses.</li><br>

    <li><span class="code">public int size()</span><br>Determines the number of courses
    currently in the list.<br><i>Preconditions:</i><br>This Planner has been
    instatiated.<br><i>Returns:</i><br>The number of Courses in this Planner.</span></li><br>

    <li><span class="code">public void addCourse(Course newCourse, int position)</span><br>
    <i>Parameters:</i><br><span class="code">newCourse</span> - the new course to
    add to the list<br><span class="code">position</span> - the position
    (preference) of this course on the list<br><i>Preconditions:</i><br>This Course
    object has been instantiated and 1 &le; <span class="code">position</span>
    &le; items_currently_in_list + 1. The number of Course objects in this Planner
    is less than MAX_COURSES.<br><i>Postconditions:</i><br>The new Course is
    now listed in the correct preference on the list. All Courses that were
    originally greater than or equal to <span class="code">position</span> are
    moved back one position. (e.g. If there are 5 Courses in a Planner, positioned 1-5,
    and you insert a Course in position 4, the new Course would be placed in
    position 4, the Course that was in position 4 will be moved to position 5, and
    the Course that was in position 5 will be moved to position 6.)<br><i>Throws:</i>
    <br><span class="code">IllegalArgumentException</span><br>Indicates that
    <span class="code">position</span> is not within the valid range.<br>
    <span class="code">FullPlannerExpcetion</span><br>Indicates that there is no
    more room in the Planner to record an additional Course.<br><i>Note 1:</i><br>
    <span class="code">position</span> refers to the position in the Planner and
    not the position in the array.<br><i>Note 2:</i><br>Inserting an item in
    position (items_currently_in_list + 1) is effectively the same as adding
    the item to the end of the list.</li><br>

    <li><span class="code">public void addCourse(Course newCourse)</span><br>Works just
    like <span class="code">public void addCourse(Course newCourse, int position)</span>,
    except adds to the end of the list.<br><i>Note:</i><br>This method can be written
    in one line using the <span class="code">addCourse()</span> and <span class="code">
    size()</span> methods above.</span></li><br>

    <li><span class="code">public void removeCourse(int position)</span><br>
    <i>Parameters:</i><br><span class="code">position</span> - the position in the
    Planner where the Course will be removed from.<br><i>Preconditions:</i><br>
    This Planner has been instantiated and 1 &le; <span class="code">position</span>
    &le; items_currently_in_list.<br><i>Postconditions:</i><br>The Course at the
    desired position has been removed. All Courses that were originally greater
    than or equal to <span class="code">position</span> are moved backward one
    position. (e.g. If there are 5 Courses in a Planner, positioned 1-5, and you
    remove the Course in position 4, the item that was in position 5 will be moved
    to position 4.)<br><i>Throws:</i><br><span class="code">IllegalArgumentException
    </span><br>Indicates that <span class="code">position</span> is not within the
    valid range.<br><i>Note:</i><br><span class="code">position</span> refers to
    the position in the Planner and not the position in the array.</li><br>

    <li><span class="code">public Course getCourse(int position)</span><br>
    <i>Parameters:</i><br><span class="code">position</span> - position of the
    Course to retrieve.<br><i>Preconditions:</i><br>The Planner object has been
    instantiated and 1 &le; <span class="code">position</span> &le; items_currenyly_in_list.
    <br><i>Returns:</i><br>The Course at the specified position in this Planner
    object.<br><i>Throws:</i><br><span class="code">IllegalArgumentException
    </span><br>Indicates that <span class="code">position</span> is not within the
    valid range.<br><i>Note:</i><br><span class="code">position</span> refers to
    the position in the Planner and not the position in the array.</li><br>

    <li><span class="code">public <font color="red">static</font> void filter(Planner planner, String department)</span><br>Prints
    all Courses that are within the specified department.<br><i>Parameters:</i><br>
    <span class="code">planner</span> - the list of courses to search in <br>
	<span class="code">department</span> - the 3 letter department code for a Course<br>
    <i>Preconditions:</i><br>This Planner object has been instantiated.<br><i>
    Postconditions:</i><br>Displays a neatly formatted table of each course filtered
    from the Planner. Keep the preference numbers the same.</li><br>

    <li><span class="code">public boolean exists(Course course)</span><br>
    Checks whether a certain Course is already in the list.<br><i>Parameters:</i><br>
    <span class="code">course</span> - the Course we are looking for<br><i>Preconditions:
    </i><br>This Planner and Course has both been instantiated.<br><i>Returns:
    </i><br>True if the Planner contains this Course, false otherwise.</li><br>

    <li><span class="code">public Object clone()</span><br>Creates a copy of this
    Planner. Subsequent changes to the copy will not affect the original and vice
    versa.<br><i>Preconditions:</i><br>This Planner object has been instantiated.
    <br><i>Returns:</i><br>A copy (backup) of this Planner object.</li><br>

    <li><span class="code">public void printAllCourses()</span><br>Prints a neatly
    formatted table of each item in the list with its position number as shown in
    the sample output.<br><i>Preconditions:</i><br>This Planner has been instantiated.
    <br><i>Postconditions:</i><br>Displats a neatly formatted table of each course
    from the Planner.<br><span class="comment">Hint: If your <span class="code">
    toString()</span> method is implemented correctly as described below, you will
    simply need to call it and print the results to the user.</span></li><br>

    <li><span class="code">public String toString()</span><br>Gets the String
    representation of this Planner object, which is a neatly formatted table
    of each Course in the Planner on its own line with its position number as
    shown in the sample output.<br><i>Returns:</i><br>The String representation
    of this Planner object.</li>
</strong></ul>

<p><strong>3. Write a fully-documented class named PlannerManager that is based
on the following specification:</strong></p>

<p><strong><span class="code">public class PlannerManager</span><br><br><span class="code">
public static void main(String[] args)</span><br>The main method runs a menu driven
application which first creates an empty Planner object. The program prompts the
user for a command to execute an operation. Once a command has been chosen, the
program may ask the user for additional information if necessary, and performs
the operation. The operations should be defined as follows:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>A - Add Course &lt;Name&gt; &lt;Code&gt; &lt;Section&gt; &lt;Instructor&gt; &lt;Position&gt;<br>Adds a new course into the list.</li>
    <li>G - Get Course &lt;Position&gt;<br>Displays information of a Course at the given position.</li>
    <li>R - Remove Course &lt;Position&gt;<br>Removes the Course at the given position.</li>
    <li>P - Print Courses in Planner<br>Displays all courses in the list.</li>
    <li>F - Filter By Department Code &lt;Code&gt;<br>Displays courses that match the given department code.</li>
    <li>L - Look For Course &lt;Name&gt; &lt;Code&gt; &lt;Section&gt; &lt;Instructor&gt;<br>Determines whether the course with the given attributes is in the list.</li>
    <li>S - Size<br>Determines the number of courses in the Planner.</li>
    <li>B - Backup<br>Creates a copy of the given Planner. Changes to the copy will not affect the original and vice versa.</li>
    <li>PB - Print Courses in Backup<br>Displays all the courses from the backed-up list.</li>
    <li>RB - Revert to Backup<br>Reverts the current Planner to the backed up copy.</li>
    <li>Q - Quit<br>Terminates the program.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. You will need classes to handle the exceptions thrown (see class
    specifications above for exception classes you need).</strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:red">Note: You may include additional methods in any
class as necessary or as you find convenient.</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><u>INPUT FORMAT:</u></strong></p>

<ul><strong>
    <li>Each menu operation is entered on its own line and should be case insensitive (i.e. 'q' and 'Q' are the same).</li>
    <li>Check to make sure that the position, if required, is valid. If not, print and error message and return to the main menu.</li>
    <li>For the Add Course command, if the input information is valid, construct the object accordingly. Otherwise, print an error message and return to the main menu.</li>
    <li>You may assume Strings are at most 25 characters long.</li>
</strong></ul>

<p><strong><u>OUTPUT FORMAT:</u></strong></p>

<ul><strong>
    <li>Each command should output the result (as shown in sample IO below) after each operation is performed.</li>
    <li>All menu operations must be accompanied by a message indicating what operation was performed and whether or not it was successful.</li>
    <span ><li>All lists must be printed in a nice and tabular form as shown in the sample output. You may use C style formatting as shown in the following example. The example below shows two different ways of displaying the name and address at pre-specified positions 21, 26, 19, and 6 spaces wide. If the '-' flag is given, then it will be left-justified (padding will be on the right), else the region is right-justified. The 's' identifier is for strings, the 'd' identifier is for integers. Giving the additional '0' flag pads an integer with additional zeroes in front.</li>
<pre>    String name = "Doe Jane";
    String address = "32 Bayview Dr.";
    String city = "Fishers Island, NY";
    int zip = 6390;

System.out.println(String.format("%-21s%-26s%19s%06d", name, address, city, zip));
System.out.printf("%-21s%-26s%19s%06d", name, address, city, zip);

Doe Jane             32 Bayview Dr.             Fishers Island, NY 06390
Doe Jane             32 Bayview Dr.             Fishers Island, NY 06390
</pre>
    </span>
</strong></ul>

<p><strong><u>HINTS:</u></strong></p>

<ul><strong>
    <li>Remember that the position parameter to all of the methods in the Planner
    class refers to the position of a Course within the collection (starting at
    position 1) and not the position in the array (which starts at position 0).
    There are two ways that you can handle this issue:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Store the item one in position 0, item two in position 1, and so on
        and so forth. Inside each method, subtract one from the position given
        by the parameter to find the appropriate location in the array.</li>
        <li>Define your array duch that it is the size of MAX_COURSES + 1 instead
        of MAX_COURSES. Store item one in position 1, item two in position 2, and
        so on and so forth. Position 0 of the array will not be used.</li>
    </ul>
</strong></ul>
