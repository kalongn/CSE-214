<p><strong>In the field of networking, information is packed into a single entity
called a packet. A packet contains the sender&#39;s information, and also extra
overhead bits that describes certain properties of the packet. Some of these
bits are used to determine the path it takes to maneuver through the network.
Packets travel through routers across the network, until they have arrived to
their specified destination.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In this assignment, you will imitate a simple network of routers by
writing a simulator, similar to the CarSimulator discussed in lecture. Note, this
is a simple representation of the actual network implemented today.</strong></p>

<p><strong>BRIEF:<br/>The router topology implemented in today&#39;s world is far too
complicated to model in a small assignment. Therefore, we will simplify this model
for our simulation. Assume we have 3 levels of routers:</strong></p>

<ul><strong>
    </strong><li><strong>Level 1: Dispatcher Router<br/>All packets in our simulation will arrive at this
        router. The job of this router is to send off the queued packets to one
        of the available routers in the second level. You will write a simple
        algorithm that determines which Level 2 routers a packet should jump to.
        (Discussed later.)</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong>Level 2: Intermediate Hop Routers<br/>These routers will accept a packet
        from the dispatcher router. There will be a user-determined amount of
        these routers. Depending the size of the packet, it takes
        a variable amount of time to process the packet. Once the arrived packets
        have been processed, the router can send those packets to their destination.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong>Level 3: Destination Router<br/>To simplify our simulation, we assume all
        packets have the same destination. The job of this router is to accept
        incoming packets after they have been sent from the second level. However,
        due to a limited bandwidth (bottleneck in the network), this router can
        only accept a limited amount of packets at a given moment. This router
        will not be used in our simulation, but note its purpose.</strong></li><strong>
</strong></ul>

<p><strong>Here is a picture of our network topology:</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cse214/hw/hw4-images/network_topology.png" alt="Network Topology"/></p>

<p><strong>BACKGROUND:<br/>Packets first arrive at the Dispatcher router. Each
packet can arrive at a probability, prob, that is determined by the user. For each
simulation time unit, a maximum of 3 packets can arrive at the Dispatcher. When a Packet
arrives at the Dispatcher, a new Packet object should be created, and its data
fields will be determined systematically based on rules we will describe later in the Packet class. On the
same time unit, the Dispatcher will decide which Intermediate router a specified
packet should be forwarded to. You are expected to write a simple algorithm that
determines the routing table. (Algorithm specified later in the specs.)<br/>When a
Packet arrives at an Intermediate router, it is placed onto its corresponding queue.
Only the first packet in the queue will be processed, while the others remain
in the queue. However, if the queue is full at the time a packet comes in, we
consider that as a buffer overflow, and the network will drop this packet. Once
the router finds that a packet is ready to be sent, it will forward it to its
final destination.<br/>The final destination receives all incoming packets from
the Intermediate routers. However, due to limited bandwidth, the destination
router can only accept a limited amount of packets, limit, which is determined
by the user. For example, if 3 packets have been finished processing by the
Intermediate routers, but the limit is 2, only 2 packets can arrive at the
destination in a simulation unit. The third packet must arrive in the next
simulation unit.</strong></p>

<p><strong><i>NOTE:<br/>Your implementation must consider fairness. That is,
Intermediate routers must take turns to send packets. For example, if Intermediate
routers 1, 2, 4, and 5 can send a packet at a given simulation unit, and the bandwidth is
2, routers 1 and 2 can send their packet. If, in the next simulation unit,
Intermediate router 3 can also send a packet, routers 4 and 5 should send, not 3.</i></strong></p>

<p><strong>To summarize, for each simulation unit, implement the cases in the
    following order:<br/></strong></p>

<ul><strong>
    </strong><li><strong>Decide whether packets have arrived at the Dispatcher. A maximum of 3
        can arrive at a given time.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong>If the Dispatcher contains unsent packets, send them off to one of the
        Intermediate routers. You will write the method <span class="code">sendPacketTo(Collection intRouters)</span>
        to decide which router the packet should be forwarded to.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong>Decrement all packets counters in the beginning of the queue at each Intermediate
        router.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong>If any packets are ready to be forwarded to the Destination router, do so.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong>Once a packet has arrived at the Destination router, take note of its arrival
        by recording the total time in the network. (Be careful of the bandwidth.)</strong></li><strong>
</strong></ul>

<p><strong>NOTE: Unlike the CarSimulator discussed in lecture (at most 1 car can
arrive at a given time), a maximum of 3 packets can arrive per time unit. Create
and use the variable <span class="code">public static final int MAX_PACKETS = 3</span>.
You can use the following code to simulate random packet arrival:<br/></strong></p>

<pre><strong><span class="code">for i in MAX_PACKETS
    if Math.random() &lt; arrivalProb
        generate new Packet
        <span class="comment">// each packet has the probability, arrivalProb, to arrive</span></span></strong></pre>

<p><strong>Implement a simulator given the following guidelines. The goal of the simulation
is to determine how various parameters can change the efficiency of the network.
You will be able to analyze the trends as you experiment with the simulation
inputs. You will be graded on how closely you follow the trends. You may add additional
variables/methods as you see fit.<strong></strong></strong></p><strong><strong>

<p><strong>1. <span class="code">public class Packet</span> - This class represents
a packet that will be sent through the network. This object contains the following
data fields:</strong></p>

<ul><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">static int packetCount</span> - this value is used to assign an id to a newly
        created packet. It will start with the value 0, and every time a new
        packet object is created, increment this counter and assign the value
        as the id of the Packet.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">int id</span> - a unique identifier for the packet. This will be systematically
        determined by using <span>packetCount</span>.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">int packetSize</span> - the size of the packet being
        sent. This value is randomly determined by the simulator by using the
        Math.random() method.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">int timeArrive</span> - the time this Packet is created
        should be recorded in this variable</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">int timeToDest</span> - this variable contains the
        number of simulation units that it takes for a packet to arrive at the
        destination router. The value will start at one hundredth of the packet
        size, that is: <span class="code">packetSize/100</span>. At every simulation
        time unit, this counter will decrease. Once it reaches 0, we can assume
        that the packet has arrived at the destination.</strong></li><strong>
</strong></ul>

<p><strong>Implement the following methods:</strong></p>

<ul><strong>
    </strong><li><strong>constructor (you may also include an overloaded constructor)</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong>getter/setters for all variables</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong>toString method that prints the Packet object in the format:<br/>
        <span class="code">[id, timeArrive, timeToDest]</span><br/>
        E.g. Packet #18 arrive at simulation unit 11
        with packet size 1234 should initially look like: <span class="code">[18, 11, 12]</span></strong></li><strong>
</strong></ul>

<p><strong>2. <span class="code">public class Router</span> - This class represents
a router in the network, which is ultimately a queue. If you use a Java API class,
you must use inheritance (extend a Java API class) to simplify the class definition.
To make it simple, we will use the same definitions for all the different types of
routers in the network. Include the following methods for queue functionality:</strong></p>

<ul><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">public Router</span> - constructor (you may overload
        the constructor)</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">public void enqueue(Packet p)</span> - adds a new Packet
        to the end of the router buffer.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">public Packet dequeue()</span> - removes the first
        Packet in the router buffer.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">public Packet peek()</span> - returns, but does not
        remove the first Packet in the router buffer.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">public int size()</span> - returns the number of
        Packets that are in the router buffer.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">public boolean isEmpty()</span> - returns whether
        the router buffer is empty or not.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">public String toString()</span> - returns a String
        representation of the router buffer in the following format:<br/>
        {[packet1], [packet2], ... , [packetN]} (See sample I/O if you are confused.)</strong></li><strong>
</strong></ul>

<p><strong>Now implement additional methods for our customized functionality:</strong></p>

<ul><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">public static int sendPacketTo(Collection routers)</span> -
        this method should loop through the list Intermediate routers. Find the
        router with the most free buffer space (contains least Packets), and return
        the index of the router. If there are multiple routers, any corresponding
        indices will be acceptable. If all router buffers are full, throw an exception.
        You must handle this in your code.</strong></li><strong>
</strong></ul>

<p><strong><i>NOTE: You will need to group all Intermediate routers together in a
group. A simple array or a Collection is an abstraction of the idea. You may use any data structure
you are familiar with and comfortable using. This includes Router[], ArrayList,
LinkedList, etc. Each router has a corresponding number, which is the index it
resides in on your list. For the scope of this assignment, indices should start
at 1.</i></strong></p>

<p><strong>3. <span class="code">public class Simulator</span> - This class contains
the main method that tests your simulation. You should not use hard-coded numbers.
Instead, all values should be received from user input. The following contains
the list of parameters you must keep track of:</strong></p>

<ul><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">Router dispatcher</span> - Level 1 router</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">Collection&lt;Router&gt; routers</span> - Level 2 routers</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">int totalServiceTime</span> - contains the running
        sum of the total time each packet is in the network. The service time per
        packet is simply <i>the time it has arrived to the Destination minus
        the time when the packet was created</i>. When a packet counter reaches
        0, dequeue it from the router queue and add the time
        to the total time. Ignore the leftover Packets in the network when
        simulation time is up.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">int totalPacketsArrived</span> - contains the total
        number of packets that has been successfully forwarded to the destination.
        When a packet counter reaches 0, dequeue it from the router queue
        and increase this count by 1.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">int packetsDropped</span> - records the number of
        packets that have been dropped due to a congested network.<br/>Note: this
        can only happen when <span class="code">sendPacketTo(Collection routers)</span>
        throws an exception.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">double arrivalProb</span> - the probability of a new
        packet arriving at the Dispatcher.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">int numIntRouters</span> - the number of Intermediate
        routers in the network.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">int maxBufferSize</span> - the maximum number of Packets
        a Router can accommodate for.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">int minPacketSize</span> - the minimum size of a Packet</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">int maxPacketSize</span> - the maximum size of a Packet</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">int bandwidth</span> - the maximum number of Packets
        the Destination router can accept at a given simulation unit</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">int duration</span> - the number of simulation units</strong></li><strong>
</strong></ul>

<p><strong>Implement the following methods:</strong></p>

<ul><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">public double simulate(/* any arguments above you find fit */)</span> -
        runs the simulator as described in the specs. Calculate and return the
        average time each packet spends within the network.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">private int randInt(int minVal, int maxVal)</span> - this
        will be your helper method that can generate a random number between minVal
        and maxVal, inclusively. Return that randomly generated number.</strong></li><strong>
    </strong><li><strong><span class="code">public static void main(String[] args)</span> - the main()
        method will prompt the user for inputs to the simulator. It will then run
        the simulator, and outputs the result. Prompt the user whether he or she
        wants to run another simulation.</strong></li><strong>
</strong></ul>

<p><strong>4. Any exception class that you find fit.</strong></p>
